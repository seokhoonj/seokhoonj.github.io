 - Commission
 - Bid-Ask Price
   - Bid-Ask Spread = Ask Price - Bid Price
 	                Bid	        Ask
        Market-Maker	Buys Low	Sells High
        Investor	Sells Low	Buys High

1.1.3 Accounting Profits vs. Economic Profits  
 - Accounting profit = Revenue - Cost
 - Economic profit = Revenue - Explicit Cost - Implicit Cost

1.1.4 Short Selling Assets    
 - Long vs. Short
 - What is Short-Selling?
   - Borrow shares of stock now
   - Immediately sell the borrowed stock
   - Buy the shares back
 - More Details on Short-Selling
   - The Short-Sale Proceeds
   - A Haircut
   - Interest
     - short rebate
     - repo rate
   - Dividends
     - lease rate

1.1.5 Payoff and Profit  
 - Profit  = Accumulated Value of cash flows at the risk-free rate
 - Payoff & Profit for a Nondividend-Paying Stock
   - Long Position
   - Short Position
 - Payoff & Profit for Zero-coupon Bond  
   $$ \text{Profit}_\text{bond}=V+\left(-Ve^{-rT}\right)e^{rT}=0 $$
   
1.2.0 Introduction  
1.2.1 Forward Contract Basics  
 - Motivation
 - Forward Contract: Example

1.2.2 Payoff and Profit  
 - Payoff of a Forward  
 $$ \text{Payoff}_\text{long forward} = \text{Spot price at expiration}\,– \text{Forward price} $$
 $$ \text{Payoff}_\text{short forward} = \text{Forward price}\,– \text{Spot price at expiration} $$

 - Profit of a Forward
 $$ 
 \begin{align} \text{Profit}_\text{long forward} 
 &= \text{AV(Cash flows)} \\
 &= \text{Payoff}_\text{long forward}+ \text{AV(Cash flows at time 0)} \\ 
 &= \text{Payoff}_\text{long forward}\,+ 0
 \end{align}

 \begin{align} \text{Profit}_\text{short forward} 
 &= \text{AV(Cash flows)} \\ 
 &= \text{Payoff}_\text{short forward}+ \text{AV(Cash flows at time 0)} \\
 &= \text{Payoff}_\text{short forward}\,+ 0  
 \end{align}
 $$

1.2.3 Four Ways of Buying a Stock  
 1. Outright purchase: Pay for the stock at time 0 and receive it at time 0
 2. Forward Contract: Pay for the stock at time T and receive it at time T
 3. Prepaid forward contract: Pay for the stock at time 0 and receive it at time T
 4. Fully leveraged purchase: Receive the stock at time 0 and pay for it at time T

1.2.4 Pricing a Forward & Prepaid Forward
 - Pricing a Prepaid Forward Contract
   - Forward Contract
   - Prepaid Forward Contract  
 $$ F_{0,T}=F_{0,T}^{P}\cdot e^{rT} $$

 - Nondividend-Paying Stock  
 $$ F_{0,T}^{P}= S(0) $$



3.1.3 Constructing a Binomial Tree
 - General Method   
   $$ \begin{align} 
   u &=  e^{(r-\delta)h+{\sigma} \sqrt{h}} \\ 
   d &=  e^{(r-\delta)h-{\sigma} \sqrt{h}}    
   \end{align} $$
   
 - Standard Binomial Tree  
   $$ \begin{align} p^{*} &=\dfrac{e^{(r-\delta)h}-d}{u-d}\\&=\dfrac{e^{(r-\delta)h}-e^{(r-\delta)h-\sigma\sqrt{h}}}{e^{(r-\delta)h+\sigma\sqrt{h}}-e^{(r-\delta)h-\sigma\sqrt{h}}} \\ &=\dfrac{1-e^{-\sigma\sqrt{h}}}{e^{\sigma\sqrt{h}}-e^{-\sigma\sqrt{h}}} \\ &= \dfrac{1-e^{-\sigma\sqrt{h}}}{(1-e^{-\sigma\sqrt{h}}) (1+e^{\sigma\sqrt{h}})} \\ &= \dfrac{1}{1+e^{\sigma\sqrt{h}}} \end{align} $$
