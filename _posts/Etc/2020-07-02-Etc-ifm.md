   - Indices
   - Commodities
   - Currencies

1.1.2 Buying and Selling Assets  
 - Market-Makers
 - Commission
 - Bid-Ask Price
   - Bid-Ask Spread = Ask Price - Bid Price
 	                Bid	        Ask
        Market-Maker	Buys Low	Sells High
        Investor	Sells Low	Buys High
 - Ways to Buy or Sell

1.1.3 Accounting Profits vs. Economic Profits

3.1.3 Constructing a Binomial Tree
 - General Method   
   $$ \begin{align} 
   u &=  e^{(r-\delta)h+{\sigma} \sqrt{h}} \\ 
   d &=  e^{(r-\delta)h-{\sigma} \sqrt{h}}    
   \end{align} $$
   
 - Standard Binomial Tree  
   $$ \begin{align} p^{*} &=\dfrac{e^{(r-\delta)h}-d}{u-d}\\&=\dfrac{e^{(r-\delta)h}-e^{(r-\delta)h-\sigma\sqrt{h}}}{e^{(r-\delta)h+\sigma\sqrt{h}}-e^{(r-\delta)h-\sigma\sqrt{h}}} \\ &=\dfrac{1-e^{-\sigma\sqrt{h}}}{e^{\sigma\sqrt{h}}-e^{-\sigma\sqrt{h}}} \\ &= \dfrac{1-e^{-\sigma\sqrt{h}}}{(1-e^{-\sigma\sqrt{h}}) (1+e^{\sigma\sqrt{h}})} \\ &= \dfrac{1}{1+e^{\sigma\sqrt{h}}} \end{align} $$
